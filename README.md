# Antenna analyzer "SWR-mouse"
EasyEDA project for simple and quick assembly of the "SWR-mouse" antenna analyzer adapted for installation in the G403 case (Gainta Industries). The project includes the "SWR-mouse" antenna analyzer schematic and the PCB file. Version for mounting SMD components. Based on the submitted files, you can independently manufacture a PCB or order its manufacturing at the factory. In turn, I developed PCB for the independently manufacturing based on the existing circuit.

| [UR5FFR • View topic - Антенный анализатор Si5351 SWR-mouse] | The original solution of the antenna analyzer "SWR-mouse" from the radio amateur UR5FFR. Article on the forum in Russian. |
| [Антенный Анализатор UR5FFR на ARDUINO и Si5351] | Video on YouTube from radio amateur R2AJI. It describes the process of manufacturing the "SWR-mouse" antenna analyzer circuit board for the G436/G407 case. In this version, there is an implementation of power supplying from a 18650 battery, a SO-239 connector, a Mini-USB power/data connector. |
